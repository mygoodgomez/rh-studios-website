            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to R.H. Studios</p>
            <p>An acting studio founded by Juilliard-trained actors, offering disciplined, supportive training in scene study, and on-camera work, with an emphasis on The Alexander Technique. Our aim is to make this level of world-class training accessible, creating space for both new and experienced actors to build a strong foundation, grow confidence and skill, and support longevity in a demanding profession.</p>
            <p>Founded by Juilliard-trained actors with professional experience on the stage and screen, who also share a love for teaching. The studio offers conservatory-level training shaped for today's industry—auditions, on-camera work, and theater—with a focus on building a sustainable, long-term career.</p>
            <p>Alongside rigorous scene and text work, the program integrates the Alexander Technique as a core part of training. Actors develop greater physical awareness and efficiency, learning how to step fully into demanding work and then step out of it with intention, without carrying unnecessary tension.</p>
            <p>This approach supports longevity in a high-pressure profession, helping actors meet both emotional and physical demands without injury, fatigue, or habitual strain.</p>

Each week, students work on new sides in a minimal-pressure setting, with limited prep time to strengthen text analysis and visual storytelling while building ease and confidence on camera.</p>
            <p>Imaginative physical work is gently integrated throughout the month to support embodiment, impulse, and truthful, grounded choices—mirroring real audition conditions in a supportive way.</p>

            <h3>The Professional Actor: Advanced / Professional Training</h3>

Created for artists who have worked extensively and are ready to reconnect with curiosity, depth, and joy, the class offers a space to train and perform alongside peers who share a high level of craft and professional experience.</p>
            <p>The lab features guest artists and teachers and integrates rigorous text analysis, on-camera technique, Alexander work, and thoughtful attention to mental health and sustainability in the profession. Actors will work on sides and, when appropriate, have the option to explore full scenes in a supportive, collaborative environment.</p>
            <p>This class prioritizes artistry over outcome, process over performance—offering a place to remember why you began, and how it feels to work fully, honestly, and in community again.</p>

            <p class="instructor-quote">"I came to the Alexander Technique as an opera singer looking to free my rigid body and shallow breathing and to enhance my abilities as a performer. AT became my secret weapon; after a lesson, everything was easier. I was finally getting out of my own way! Later in my life, I sustained a neck injury that was so serious it not only jeopardized my singing, but caused a great deal of pain in my day-to-day living. It was my AT teacher who made the greatest impact on my recovery, helping me to calm intense pain and muscle spasms and rediscover my body's natural harmony and coordination."</p>

          <div class="alexander-text">
            <h3>What is Alexander Technique?</h3>
            <p>Alexander Technique is awareness in action. It is a method of examining how our habits interfere with performance and in our everyday lives and developing problem-solving strategies with a teacher's hands-on or online guidance. AT is not learning to DO something new, it is learning to UNDO the habits that stand between you and your potential.</p>

            <h3>How is it implemented at R.H Studios?</h3>
            <p>Starting in March 2026, two of our four monthly classes will open with 45-60 minutes of Alexander Technique as an introduction to the work. As our community grows, we will continue expanding Alexander offerings throughout the year.</p>

        <h2>WHY ALEXANDER TECHNIQUE</h2>
        <div class="why-alexander-content">
          <p>The Alexander Technique has long been a core component of actor training at leading conservatories and top drama schools, taught alongside acting, movement, and voice throughout the entire program. Its importance lies not only in learning technique, but in learning how to use that technique in the body when the work becomes demanding. As actors take on text, emotion, repetition, and pressure, the Alexander Technique offers practical tools for awareness, coordination, and choice—helping actors recognize habitual patterns and work with greater ease rather than strain. In this way, it is as essential as acting class itself, supporting actors in applying what they learn clearly, consistently, and sustainably over the course of a long professional career.</p>
